This project is a React application where a user can interact with [MINKA's API](https://api.minka-sdg.org/v1/docs/)
to browse the taxonomy of all species that the citizen science portal has information on. It also offers the possibility to take a quizz on the different species within a taxonomic group to hone your visual ID skills!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
