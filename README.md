# MinkaID

This project is a React application where a user can interact with [MINKA's API](https://api.minka-sdg.org/v1/docs/)
to browse the taxonomy of all species that the citizen science portal has information on. It also offers the possibility to take a quizz on the different species within a taxonomic group to hone your visual ID skills!
